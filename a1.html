    <p> The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and is about 384,000 kilometers away from us. It reflects sunlight, which is
    why we can see it glowing in the night sky. The Moon goes through different phases, such as new moon, crescent, and full
    moon, based on its position between the Earth and the Sun. Its gravity also affects Earth's tides, pulling ocean water
    to create high and low tides. In 1969, astronauts from NASA's Apollo 11 mission became the first humans to walk on the
    Moon, marking a major moment in space exploration.</p>

    <p> The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system and is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. It produces energy
    through nuclear fusion, which gives off the light and heat that support life on Earth. The Sun is so large that about
    one million Earths could fit inside it. Its energy drives weather, helps plants grow, and keeps Earth warm enough for
    living things. Even though it's incredibly far away about 150 million kilometers it's the most important source of
    energy for all life on our planet.</p>
